## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or later) and a package manager like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd Wishestra
    ```

2.  **Install project dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

This application requires two processes to be running simultaneously: the mock backend server and the frontend development server.

#### 1. Run the Backend

The application uses `json-server` to simulate a REST API.

1.  **Install `json-server`** (if you don't have it):

    ```bash
    npm install -g json-server
    ```

2.  **Start the server**. In the root of your project, run the following command. This will watch the `db.json` file and serve its content on `http://localhost:3000`.
    ```bash
    json-server --watch db.json
    ```
    _You should see a message confirming that the server is running._

#### 2. Run the Frontend

1.  **Open a new terminal window** and navigate to the project directory.

2.  **Start the React development server**:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Open your browser** and navigate to the URL provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`). You should now see the Wishestra application running!
